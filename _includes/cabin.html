                <h3>The Cabin <br>At Mulberry Spring</h3>

                <p>A rustic two story cottage that dates back to the early years of the estate. The cabin has a cozy living space with a wood burning stove and exposed beams overhead. The kitchen is fully equipped and the bathroom offers a clawfoot tub shower. Upstairs you'll find a charming bedroom with a queen-sized bed. The sitting porch out front offers a perfect place to watch the sunset.  </p>
