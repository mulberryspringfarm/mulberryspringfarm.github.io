description: A spacious timber framed barn sitting at the wood's edge, furnished with hand-made farm-style furniture. Designed for the artisan, the second story windows allow generous amounts of natural light to flood the entire space. A full kitchen downstairs transitions into a living area facing a garage door which puts your living room outside!
